# Production Readiness

Status: Not ready for broad customer launch; live Messenger smoke and delete-data flow are operator-verified, while live Mollie billing is NO-GO.

Last updated: 2026-06-30

Canonical release strategy and open work are tracked in
[`docs/operations/todo.md`](operations/todo.md).
This document is the deploy/smoke checklist for the current gateway surface.

## Production Flow

1. Meta calls `GET /facebook/webhook` for webhook verification.
2. Meta sends Messenger `POST /facebook/webhook` events with `X-Hub-Signature-256`.
3. The plugin verifies signature, JSON content type, request size/body validity, and registered Page/account target.
4. Inbound events are acknowledged quickly with `200 {"status":"ok"}` and processed in the background.
5. `dmPolicy` gates senders through OpenClaw pairing/allowlist/open access before assistant dispatch.
6. Text-only fast-lane messages can reply directly for greeting/help/status/image intent.
7. Messenger image-generation intents are routed to the separate Leaderbot image-generation service only when `leaderbotBridgeEnabled: true` and a valid internal bridge token are configured.
8. Source-photo generation only uses an uploaded/stored photo when the prompt explicitly asks to edit/restyle that photo.
9. Photo-only/image-analysis messages stay in the OpenClaw assistant path instead of auto-restyling.
10. Assistant replies are sent through Graph API `/{pageId}/messages` as `messaging_type: RESPONSE`.
11. Errors are logged with hashed Messenger identifiers; raw PSIDs, tokens, and message text should not be logged.

## Blocking Issues Fixed

- Fixed Fly gateway workspace persistence: OpenClaw now uses `/data/workspace` through `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR`.
- Added startup migration for missing legacy markdown files from `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace` to `/data/workspace`.
- Kept existing persistent workspace files safe: migration only copies missing files.
- Repaired persisted config when it contains the known legacy default workspace path.
- Kept OpenClaw built-in `image_generate` denied on the public gateway; Messenger image generation stays routed through Leaderbot image-gen.
- Added a public-open Facebook DM tool denylist for high-cost/risky OpenClaw tools (`image_generate`, browser/canvas/web fetch/firecrawl, exec, and filesystem mutation tools).
- Added the Fly public route guard: webhook and health routes stay public, customer portal/legal routes can be proxied to Leaderbot, and the broader OpenClaw gateway UI/API is not reachable from the internet.

## Remaining Blockers

- Live image generation requires the separate `leaderbot-fb-image-gen` service key and OpenAI billing/key state to be healthy.
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` could not complete from this Windows environment because the registry audit endpoint request failed with `EACCES`; rerun from CI or another network before broad launch.
- Broad customer launch still requires the remaining portal, billing, usage-control, monitoring, and tenant-isolation work tracked in the canonical backlog.
- Live Mollie billing is blocked by the explicit items in `LAUNCH_READINESS.md`, including sandbox evidence and workspace-entitlement enforcement in provider quota paths.

## Latest Operator Verification

- Live Messenger smoke was verified by operator on 2026-06-30 with the real Page.
- `delete-my-data` / GDPR deletion behavior was verified by operator on 2026-06-30.
- Messenger photo forwarding and storage-proxy delivery for generated/source images were verified by operator on 2026-06-30 with tester photo forwards.

## Required Fly Secrets / Env Vars

Gateway app: `leaderbot-openclaw-gateway`

- `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` or `MESSENGER_APP_SECRET`
- `MESSENGER_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `MESSENGER_PAGE_ID`
- `MESSENGER_VERIFY_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
- `LEADERBOT_IMAGE_GEN_INTERNAL_TOKEN`

Important env:

- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data`
- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=/data/openclaw.json`
- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace`
- `OPENCLAW_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_GUARD=1`
- `OPENCLAW_FACEBOOK_LEADERBOT_BRIDGE_ENABLED=1` only for the intentional public Leaderbot gateway
- `LEADERBOT_IMAGE_GEN_URL=https://leaderbot-fb-image-gen.fly.dev`

Image-gen app must have matching internal token:

- `INTERNAL_IMAGE_REQUEST_TOKEN` must match `LEADERBOT_IMAGE_GEN_INTERNAL_TOKEN`.

Mollie billing variables are documented in `apps/image-gen/.env.example`. Keep
`MOLLIE_BILLING_ENABLED=false`, `MOLLIE_MODE=test`, and
`MOLLIE_LIVE_BILLING_ENABLED=false` while the public site only collects
early-access interest. Enable the master switch only in an approved test
environment or after the billing launch decision is GO.

The token alone must not enable forwarding. The Facebook channel config also
needs `leaderbotBridgeEnabled: true` for any Messenger event, Page-scoped sender
ID, prompt, or media URL to be sent to the separate Leaderbot image-generation
service.

## Deploy Command

```bash
fly deploy -a leaderbot-openclaw-gateway
```

## Smoke-Test Commands

Health:

```bash
curl -I https://leaderbot-openclaw-gateway.fly.dev/healthz
curl -I https://leaderbot-fb-image-gen.fly.dev/healthz
```

Image-gen readiness and metrics:

```bash
curl -fsS https://leaderbot-fb-image-gen.fly.dev/readyz
curl -fsS https://leaderbot-fb-image-gen.fly.dev/metrics
```

Check persistent workspace path after deploy:

```bash
fly ssh console -a leaderbot-openclaw-gateway
cd /data/workspace
ls -la
```

Check logs:

```bash
fly logs -a leaderbot-openclaw-gateway
```

## Release Gate Checklist

Before deploy:

- Confirm rollback target with `fly releases -a leaderbot-openclaw-gateway`.
- Confirm the gateway `/healthz` route is reachable and no additional gateway UI/API routes are publicly exposed.
- Confirm image-gen `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` are reachable.
- Confirm image-gen queue metrics show bounded `messenger_generation_queue_jobs{state="queued"}`, `messenger_generation_queue_jobs{state="processing"}`, and `messenger_generation_global_slots{state="active"}`.
- Confirm failed/dead-lettered generation jobs are zero or have an owner-reviewed incident note.
- Confirm recent logs contain no raw PSIDs, access tokens, customer messages, uploaded knowledge, generated prompts, or generated outputs.
- Confirm no public route exposure drift from the intended webhook/health/legal/customer-app surfaces.
- Confirm Messenger prompt routing follows the operator-facing routing guide:
  ordinary conversation stays on OpenClaw, prompt-first image generation and
  source-photo edits are forwarded only through the explicit Leaderbot bridge,
  and cap/failure fallbacks are visible through metadata-only trace stages. See
  [`operator-prompt-routing.md`](operator-prompt-routing.md).
- Create a metadata-only smoke evidence file with `npm run messenger:smoke-template > smoke-evidence.json`.

After deploy:

- Re-run gateway `/healthz` and image-gen `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics`.
- Confirm `webhook_ack_sent` latency stays within the current production target and event-loop p95/p99 remains below the documented rollout threshold.
- Confirm queue depth drains normally, failed/dead-lettered job counts do not increase, and worker lease/reclaim logs are healthy after a worker restart or deploy event.
- Run the manual Messenger smoke below with the real Page.
- Record metadata-only release notes: commit, image/release id, smoke result, rollback target, and any cost/quota anomalies.
- Validate the smoke evidence before sharing or archiving it with `npm run messenger:smoke-validate -- smoke-evidence.json`.

Manual Messenger smoke:

- Send `ben je online`; expect a status reply.
- Send a normal text question; expect an assistant reply.
- Send a photo without edit text; expect the photo-received prompt asking what to change, not an automatic generated replacement image.
- Send `maak een afbeelding van ...`; expect the image-gen service path.
- Send `maak een futuristische stad bij zonsondergang`; expect text-to-image, not a style-picker default.
- Send `maak een prompt voor een afbeelding`; expect the normal assistant path, not image generation.
- Send a source photo plus explicit edit text such as `maak me cyberpunk`; expect the source-image edit path.

## Rollback Notes

Use Fly deployment history to identify the previous stable deployment, then roll back:

```bash
fly releases -a leaderbot-openclaw-gateway
fly deploy -a leaderbot-openclaw-gateway --image <previous-image>
```

The workspace migration is non-destructive: it only copies missing files into `/data/workspace` and does not remove legacy files.

## Known Risks

- Public `dmPolicy: "open"` should not be enabled until paywall, consent, deletion, quota, and abuse controls are product-ready.
- Public Pages need clear privacy/data-retention terms before open mode or
  Leaderbot free-tier image generation is enabled.
- Keep `leaderbotBridgeEnabled` false unless external Leaderbot processing is
  intended and disclosed.
- Messenger `RESPONSE` messages are constrained by Meta's response window.
- Provider/API billing failures surface as assistant/image-generation failures; smoke tests must include the live keys.
- The current local validation does not replace Meta App Review, Page permission, and webhook subscription checks.
