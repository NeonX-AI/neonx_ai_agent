This plugin gives OpenClaw a Facebook Page inbox. After setup, people can send a
direct message to your Facebook Page and OpenClaw can receive it, decide what to
do, and reply through Messenger.

It is meant as a clear starting point for building on the Meta platform: connect
a Meta app, a Facebook Page, and the Messenger product, then let OpenClaw handle
Facebook Page Messenger DMs through Meta webhooks.

V1 is intentionally focused: Facebook Page Messenger direct messages only. It
does not yet implement comments, Private Replies/comment-to-DM flows, Instagram
DMs, broader Meta automation, or general OpenClaw attachment workflows. Inbound
media attachments are handled only as supported Messenger payloads for DM
ingestion, unless the optional Leaderbot bridge is explicitly enabled.

The plugin is called `facebook` because this is the Facebook/Meta integration
surface. Legacy `messenger`, `fb`, and `fbm` aliases remain temporarily for
existing installs only.

## Install

Private phase:

```bash
openclaw plugins install <private-git-or-tarball-url>
```

ClawHub phase:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@dj-shortcut/facebook
```

Public phase:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @dj-shortcut/facebook
```

## Repository Layout

This repository is a monorepo containing the Facebook/OpenClaw integration and the Leaderbot customer portal.

- **Facebook Plugin (Root):** The core OpenClaw channel plugin for Facebook Page Messenger. It handles webhooks and message transport.
- **Leaderbot Portal (`apps/image-gen`):** A full-stack application (Vite/React + Node/Express) that serves as the customer portal (`leaderbot.live`) and the image-generation service.
- **Fly Gateway (`deploy/fly-gateway`):** Deployment configuration for the OpenClaw gateway with a public route guard.

Deploy targets:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
pnpm run deploy:image-gen
pnpm run deploy:gateway
```

Legacy aliases (still available):

```bash
pnpm run gateway:deploy
pnpm run image-gen:deploy
```

## Configure

Use `channels.facebook` for new installs:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    facebook: {
      enabled: true,
      pageId: "<FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID>",
      pageAccessToken: "<FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
      appSecret: "<FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET>",
      verifyToken: "<FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN>",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
    },
  },
}
```

Default webhook:

```text
https://<gateway-host>/facebook/webhook
```

Do not configure a second active `messenger` channel. Existing
`channels.messenger` config and `MESSENGER_*` secrets remain temporary
fallbacks, but new installs should use `channels.facebook` and `FACEBOOK_*`.
The old `/messenger/webhook` path is not the new default; keep it only if an
existing deployment explicitly configured that legacy `webhookPath`.

See [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md) for the short setup tutorial, and
[`docs/facebook-complete-tutorial.md`](docs/facebook-complete-tutorial.md) for
the full Meta-side guide covering the app, Page identity, permissions, review,
Messenger rules, production checks, and troubleshooting.
See [`docs/openclaw-update.md`](docs/openclaw-update.md) for the single
supported OpenClaw update, rollback, runtime validation, and release workflow.
See [`docs/clawhub.md`](docs/clawhub.md) for ClawHub release preparation.
See [`docs/cost-control-plan.md`](docs/cost-control-plan.md) for the recommended
budget, usage-ledger, and payment boundaries for public Facebook assistants.
See [`docs/x-twitter-companion.md`](docs/x-twitter-companion.md) only if the
same OpenClaw assistant also needs X/Twitter search, monitors, webhooks, media
workflows, follower export, giveaway draws, or approval-reviewed tweet posts.
TweetClaw is a separate optional third-party plugin maintained outside this
repository; it is not required for Facebook Page Messenger DMs.

## Access model

Default setup uses `dmPolicy: "pairing"` so unknown Facebook users receive a
pairing code before they can talk to the assistant. For a public Page bot, use
`dmPolicy: "open"` with `allowFrom: ["*"]` to let anyone message the Page only
after you have published privacy and data-retention terms for that public
Messenger experience. For private installs, prefer `pairing` or `allowlist`.

Open means the conversation entry point is public; it should not grant unknown users
privileged tools, private memory, files, git/deploy access, or admin actions.
Use separate OpenClaw permissions/tool policy for that trusted core.
Public users may send personal, financial, authentication, or business-sensitive
information into Messenger. In open mode, those messages can be forwarded into
your OpenClaw host, model provider, logs, memory, and any enabled tools according
to your runtime configuration. Publish a privacy policy, disclose automated/AI
handling where required, and decide what data is retained, deleted, or shared
with third-party providers before enabling this for a public Page.
For paid or public assistants, keep billing, credits, model selection, and tool
budgets in the OpenClaw host runtime where provider calls execute.

## Optional Leaderbot image-generation bridge

This package can optionally forward Messenger events and image-generation
prompts to the separate Leaderbot image-generation service. That path can send
Messenger event payloads, Page-scoped sender IDs, prompt text, and Messenger
media URLs outside the OpenClaw host. It is disabled by default for ClawHub and
private installs, even if `LEADERBOT_IMAGE_GEN_INTERNAL_TOKEN` or
`INTERNAL_IMAGE_REQUEST_TOKEN` exists in the host environment.

Enable it only when the Page is intentionally using Leaderbot image generation
and the Page's privacy/data-retention terms disclose that processing:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    facebook: {
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
      leaderbotBridgeEnabled: true,
      unknownSenderMode: "leaderbot_free_tier"
    }
  }
}
```

The bridge still requires a valid internal token and an HTTPS
`LEADERBOT_IMAGE_GEN_URL` unless you are using localhost for development.

## Conversation Actions

Assistant replies may include channel-neutral `actions`:

```json
{
  "text": "What would you like to do next?",
  "actions": [
    { "id": "edit_image", "label": "Edit image", "inputText": "Edit image" },
    { "id": "new_image", "label": "New image", "inputText": "New image" }
  ]
}
```

The Facebook channel renders these actions as Messenger quick replies. When a
person clicks one, the action id is decoded back into the next inbound message
text, so the assistant receives it like normal user input instead of a
Messenger-specific payload branch.

## Local/private install validation

This plugin does not need to be published to npm before it can be installed
privately:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run pack:dry
npm pack
openclaw plugins install ./dj-shortcut-facebook-*.tgz
openclaw channels list
```

Expected channel listing: `Facebook`. There should be no separate `Messenger`
channel.

## Development

Use Node.js `>=24.15.0`, matching the package runtime contract, before installing
dependencies.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run pack:dry
npm run openclaw:validate
```

Run Fallow from the repository root when you want a repo-wide dead-code and
maintainability pass:

```bash
npm run fallow:report
npm run fallow:report:production
```

The primary maintainability badge at the top of this README is generated from
the full-repo `.fallow/report.json` and published to
`public/badges/fallow-maintainability.json`. The production badge is generated
from the full-repo `.fallow/report-production.json`, which excludes test/dev
files and is published to `public/badges/fallow-production-maintainability.json`.
The image-generation app badge is a secondary app-level signal from
`apps/image-gen/.fallow/report.json`; it can stay green while repo-wide health
declines in other packages, root plugin code, or unsupported/static-analysis
entrypoints.

Badge JSON is refreshed only by the Fallow workflow on scheduled or manual runs
against `main`. Pull requests generate reports for review, but they do not write
badge changes.

Do not commit real Page tokens, app secrets, verify tokens, PSIDs, or live
deployment config.
